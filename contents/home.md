Hi! My name is Hua-Yang Wang, and I am currently a junior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU), majoring in Physics(Strengthen Foundation Program). With a solid foundation in mathematics and physics, I am familiar with programming languages such as Python and C++, and comfortable using the Linux system.


#### Research Interests       
• **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**: Have a strong interest in the theories and applications of machine learning and neural networks. Currently self-studying these subjects to deepen my understanding and technical skills.          
• **Artificial Intelligence Hallucinations**: Intrigued by the phenomenon of AI hallucinations, where AI systems generate outputs that are plausible but incorrect or nonsensical. Eager to explore methods for improving the reliability and accuracy of AI models.        
• **Communication and Coordination Skills**: Recognizing the importance of effective communication in collaborative research environments, I focus on developing strong communication and coordination abilities alongside my technical expertise.          
• **Contribution to Cutting-edge Technology Research**: My ultimate goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research in technology, aiming to make a meaningful impact in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Looking forward, I am eager to pursue opportunities for further studies and research after my expected graduation in 2026.
